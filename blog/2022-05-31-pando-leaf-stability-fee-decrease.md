Pando Leaf has lowered the [stability fees](https://docs.pando.im/docs/leaf/key-concepts/vaults) across collaterals.

Specifically, the changes are:
- Decrease the BTC Stability Fee from 4.5% to 1%.
- Decrease the sETH-BTC Stability Fee from 5.5% to 1%.
- Decrease the ETH Stability Fee from 5.5% to 1.5%.

- Decrease the DOT Stability Fee from 5.5% to 1.5%.
- Decrease the UNI Stability Fee from 5.5% to 1.5%.

#### What does this mean to you?

With these changes, minting pUSD against the above mentioned collateral assets is cheaper for you. If combining with other Pando products, you can even have a potential of earning sizable yields. For example, currently you can now supply pUSD in [Pando Rings](https://rings.pando.im/#/) and enjoy the APY for supplying pUSD at around 15.6% while borrowing pUSD from Pando Leaf at only 1% - 1.5%. As you can see, the loan grows at a lower rate than the principal.
