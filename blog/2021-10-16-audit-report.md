I'm glad to tell you that the Pando has been audited by IOActive & LeastAuthority.  View the results below:

[https://docs.pando.im/docs/security/audit-reports/](https://docs.pando.im/docs/security/audit-reports/)

The audit report supports downloading and viewing. At the same time, we listed the problems reflected in the audit report, fixed bugs, and proposed targeted analysis.

The subsequent pando series of products will complete all audits one after another. As we said, pando is an open source project and worthy of trust.
