[Pando](pando.im) is an open source DeFi project based on [Mixin Network](https://mixin.one/snapshots) that uses [MTG](https://docs.pando.im/docs/security/mtg) to keep funds safe. The accumulated assets under management have reached 327M $ and the DEX‚Äî‚Äî [4swap](https://4swap.org) is ranked around 30 in the world.

To thank all our users for support and to let more people know about us, there will be some events that everyone can participat in and will have a chance to get rewards.

### Create a Mixin Wallet

In order to easily receive your event rewards, you must have a wallet on the Mixin Network. There are two easy ways to get one.

- Download [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) and register an account to have a Mixin wallet.
- Creating a [Fennec](https://pando.im/fennec) web Mixin wallet.

You can also see how to install both wallets at [Wallet](https://docs.pando.im/docs/apps/wallets).

### View Wallet Address & Transfer

If you use Mixin Messenger, you can see the various types of cryptocurrencies when you open the wallet and click on Transfer to view the wallet address.

> Consult the Mixin documentation: [How to deposit on Mixin Messenger?](https://mixinmessenger.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018789931-How-to-deposit-on-Mixin-Messenger)

Also, you can receive transfers from others by viewing your Mixin ID as follows.
