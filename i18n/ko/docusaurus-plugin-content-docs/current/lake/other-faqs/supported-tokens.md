In theory, we can provide support for the assets supported by Mixin Network, but the current list of assets we choose to support is based on the following rules:

- Strong ecosystem or high reputation in the blockchain industry.

- Considerable community base in the Mixin ecosystem.

- The project owner is willing to provide assets as the initial liquidity market maker, and the net value reaches the standard recognized by the Fox.ONE team.
