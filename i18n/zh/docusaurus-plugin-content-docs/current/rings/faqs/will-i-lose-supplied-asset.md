### If you don't have any loans:
Generally, the answer is NO. 您获得了您提供的资产的利息并且您不需要支付任何费用。

In the very extreme situation though, as assets available to borrow on the market all come from users' supply, if there are bad debts (meaning a loan that is not likely to be paid), there is a chance that you cannot get back the full amount of your supplied assets. However, **it is unlikely to happen** in Pando Rings as liquidation is monitored real-time by liquidating bots (algorithms to execute liquidation) to avoid bad debts from happening.


### 如果您确实有贷款：
如果您所借的资产的价值超过了您的[借贷限额](../key-concepts/glossary.md)您将进入[清算](../key-concepts/liquidation.md)失去您的部分抵押品(担保资产). 在您提供的全部资产中，进行清算的是担保资产而未进行担保的资产将保持不变。

It is important tht you pay close attention to the [loan risk indicator](../key-concepts/loan-risk-indicator.md) to monitor your loan risk, and keep your collateral safe from liquidation.
