Pando Lots provides APIs to access communities and conversations based on Mixin Messenger's messages service.

## Community

A community is a group of users who share the same interests. A community is identified by a Mixin Digital ID. A community can be public or private. A public community can be joined by anyone. A private community can be joined by invitation or payment.

## How to engage with a community

There are two ways to engage with a community:

### 1. Use Mixin Messenger

1. Sign up a Mixin Messenger account. Download Messenger from https://mixin.one/mm and sign up.
2. Search the community ID in Mixin Messenger. For example, Pando's community ID is 7000104110, and you can search it by entering 7000104110 in Mixin Messenger.

### 2. Web Access

If the community is public and the community owner has enabled the web access, you can access the community via web browsers.
