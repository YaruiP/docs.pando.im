In Pando Rings, if the value of your borrowing rises above the level of your borrowing capacity, liquidation will happen. Others will pay back some or all of your borrowed assets and get your corresponding collateral at a discounted price.
 
You will not be able to borrow, unpledge or withdraw from your pledged assets while you are in liquidation. 

After liquidation, your loan will be reduced to a safe level or paid off while you will lose your corresponding collateral. 
 
Liquidation can occur when the collateral asset drops in value or when the value of borrowed asset rises too high.
