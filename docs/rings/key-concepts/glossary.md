#### Key Processes 

**Supply**

**Pledge** 

**Unpledge** 

**Withdraw** 

**Borrow** 

**Repay** 

**rToken** 
rToken is an ERC-20 token that is essentially a tokenized supply position and can be used as collateral in other liquidity pool or exchanged for other crypto assets. 

**Liquidation** 
When a user's maximum borrow capacity rendered by the total collateral value cannot cover the total loan value, liquidation will happen. In the process, others repay some or all of the user's outstanding borrow on behalf of the borrower and in return receive a discounted amount of collateral held by the borrower. 

#### Market 

**Total Supply**

**Supply Volume** 
It stands for the total supplied amount of a specific asset in the market of the very moment.

**Total Borrow** 

**liquidity** 

**Maximum Market Availability** 

**24h Supply**

**24h Borrow** 

**Supply APY**
The estimated annual percentage yield for supplying an asset. 

**Borrow APY**
The estimated annual interest rate of an asset a borrower need to pay. 

**Collateral Factor** 
It represents the maximum percentage you can borrow of the value of your pledged asset. It may vary for different assets. An asset that has a more solid community base and higher market recognition tends to have higher collateral factor. 

#### Key Personal Metrics 

**Net APY**
Net APY(annual percentage yield) reflects the estimatd annual net yield based on the Supply APY and Borrow APY of the very moment. It indicates whether you are making money or losing money at the current APYS. 

**Borrow Limit** 
The maximum amount you can borrow. You can increase your borrow limit by increasing the collateral (pledging more assets).

**Borrow Balance**
Borrow Balance = Borrow Limit - Your Borrow. It is the amount you can yet to borrow. If your Borrow Balance is 0, you cannot borrow any asset anymore. 

**Borrow/Borrow Limit** 
It is the percentage of a user's Borrow against the maximum borrow capacity. Itis used to indicate your loan risk. 

**My Supply**
The total amount of all the assets you have supplied (principal plus the accrued interests).

**My Borrow** 
The total amount of all the assets you have borrowed (principal plus the accrued interests).

**Total Pledge**
