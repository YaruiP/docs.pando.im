If you want to borrow, you will need to pledge as borrowing in Pando Rings function on the collateral-backed mechanism.  

After pledging, the rTokens you get from supplying will be locked into the system. You will not be able to transfer your pledged rTokens to others, but you can still gain supply interest of those you pledge.

To pledge, you can click on the supplied asset card of the Supply section on the Me page. 

Drag on the progress bar to choose the percentage you want to pledge. As the amount change, the status of the risk loan indicator also change. You can pay close attention to the indicator to monitor the predicted risk of the loan after you pledge.
