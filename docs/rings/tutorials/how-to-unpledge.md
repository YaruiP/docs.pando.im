If you need to use the locked rTokens, you may want to unpledge. After unpledging, you will be able to freely transfer the rTokens to anyone as any other assets or you can go on to withdraw, getting back the underlying asset from your rTokens.

To unpledge, click on "Unpledge" of the supplied asset card of the Supply section on the Me page.

**Pledging** shows the amount of a specific asset you have pledged. **Total Pledge** is the total amount of all the assets you have pledged.
