Do pay attention to the risk indication bar. You have to keep your **collateralization ratio**(link to the explanation required) in a safe range to avoid **liquidation** (link). When your collateralization ratio breaches the **liquidation ratio** (link), your collaterals will be in **auction** (link to auction process).
