Adding Collateral is useful in two scenarios. The first is when a Vault is coming close to being **liquidated** (link to liquidation), adding collateral can save the Vault. The second is when a Vault owner wants to increase their capacity for generating pUSD, adding collateral will increase the maximum amount of pUSD that can be generated.

To add collateral, click on "Deposit" and fill in the intended amount on the Deposit page.
