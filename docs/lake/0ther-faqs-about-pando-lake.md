## Which is Impermanet lossï¼Ÿ

Impermanent loss, also known as temporary loss.

Users provide liquidity to the platform, and there is a risk of loss, which is called impermanent loss. Due to the design mechanism of the automated market maker (AMM), the AMM platform may not automatically change the price when the external price changes without the intervention of arbitrageurs. At this time, external arbitrageurs will profit from the price difference between the platform and the external exchange. At the same time, users who provided liquidity for the platform suffered losses.

## What should I do if I only injected one currency and didn't return it?

When you inject liquidity into the fund pool, if you deposit only one currency by mistake, Pando Lakewill cancel the order and automatically complete the refund within 10 minutes. The returned currency is automatically deposited into your Mixin wallet.

In addition, when you inject liquidity into the fund pool and inject two currencies at the same time, it is also possible to return the excess currency according to the proportion.
