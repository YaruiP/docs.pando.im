## II. Using other networks to send money to the MVM network

It is crucial to make clear that in the following two steps, cross-link bridge is used, not address transfer, to send data to the MVM network via MetaMask.

1. Launch the [Assets Bridge](https://mvg.finance/) and link the MetaMask wallet.
